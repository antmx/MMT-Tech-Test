There are some unit tests around the code that accesses the Customer Account Details API.

I would also have:
 - implemented the "Gift" requirement but ran out of time.
 - added unit tests around the DbClient.
 - added unit tests around the OrdersController methods.
 - used stored procedures instead of hard-coded SQL.
 - formatted the JSON dates as per the spec
